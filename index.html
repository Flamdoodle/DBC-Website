			<h2>I love to travel!</h2>
			<p>I am a world traveller!  From a young age, my parents instilled into my sister and me the need to explore the world and learn everything that we could about different cultures.  As a result, I go on adventures whenever I have the time.  Along the way, I’ve picked up various skills and had loads of fun.  I can’t wait to go on a different kind of adventure with all of you once we reach NYC!</p>

			<h2>A quirk? Well, I'm pretty quirky.</h2>
			<p>I’m a bit of a silly person, and I do many silly things.  I have a strange love of weird noises, and this probably has something to do with the didgeridoo I keep in my kitchen.  There is no better ice breaker than “Yes, that is a didgeridoo.  Yes, I can play it.”</p>

			<p>I also love animals, and instead of being content with having pets or volunteering at a local shelter, my friend and I decided that we’d spend our summers in high school at the zoo…as almost zoo keepers.  I have loads of stories that I could tell all of you (though most of them would have to do with cleaning up you know what :P )! Below this is a picture of a tamandua who thought my shows were food.</p>
